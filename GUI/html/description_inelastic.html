		<h2> Rotor model </h2>
		<p> In the rotor model, the excitation is considered as a rotation of a deformed nuclei.
		Briefly deformed potetial can be described as 
<!--		\[ V(R,\xi) = U(R) - U^\prime(R)\sum_\lambda \delta_\lambda \frac{\sqrt{4\pi}}{\hat{\lambda}} \sum_m Y^m_\lambda(\hat{\xi}) Y^m_\lambda(\hat{R})^*\] -->
		\[ U_\textrm{inelastic}(r) = \delta~\frac{d U(r)}{dr} \]
		where \( U(r) \) can be \( V_\textrm{coul}(r), U_\textrm{vol}(r) \) or \( U_\textrm{surf}(r) \). <br>
		For Coulomb deformation, the matrix elements for the transition from nuclear spin \(I_i\) to \(I_f\) are asymptotically 
<!--		\[  V^\lambda_{fi} \sim \frac{\sqrt{4\pi} e^2 Z_t}{2\lambda+1} \frac{1}{R^{\lambda+1}} \frac{3Z_p \delta_\lambda R_c^{\lambda-1}}{4\pi} I_i\langle I_iK,\lambda 0|I_f K\rangle \] -->
		\[  V^\lambda_{fi}(R) \sim \frac{~~3 e^2}{\sqrt{4\pi}} \frac{Z_p Z_t}{2\lambda+1} \frac{R_c^{\lambda-1}}{R^{\lambda+1}} \delta_\lambda~\hat{I_i}\langle I_i K,\lambda 0|I_f K\rangle \]
		and for nuclear deformation those are
		\[ V^\lambda_{fi}(R) = -\frac{\delta_\lambda}{\sqrt{4\pi}}~U^\prime(R)~\hat{I_i}\langle I_i K,\lambda 0|I_f K\rangle~~.\] </p>
		<p>	In principle, the transferred angular momentum \(\delta_L\) is determined by the ground and excited state given at [Partition tab].
		We will provide a guide for available \(\Delta L\).
		Here your input parameter is \(\beta_L\) which is related to the deforamtion length \(\delta_L\) and the average surface radius \(R_0\) : \(\beta_L = \delta_L / R_0\)
		where we take \(R_0 = 1.2~A^{1/3}\). </p>
     <!--
		<h2> Cluster model</h2>
		<p> The cluster model treats a nucleus as a combination of two or more sub-nuclei.
		In inelastic scattering the excitation is modeled as a change of single-particle energy level in a cluster.
		In this case transition potential for multiple component \(\lambda\) is
		\[ V^\lambda_{fi}(R) = \int_0^\infty \textrm{d}r~u_{l_f s j_f}(r)\mathcal{F}_\lambda(R,r) u_{l_i s j_i}(r)~\hat{\lambda}~\hat{l_i}~\langle l_i0,\lambda0|l_f0 \rangle ~~.\]	
		<p> One have to specify the core and valence particle and the change of valence particle level.
		For the convenience, available \(L\) and \(j\) will be suggested according to each state.
		Also principal quantum number \(n\) should be required.
		Especially in case the valence is a single nucleon (proton or neutron), \(n\) is easily assumed in viwepoint of the shell model.
		The bindig energies (BE) are calculated automatically, but you can put the values directly if you want. </p>

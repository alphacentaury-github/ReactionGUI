		<p> In general, the elastic scattering would be described with the optical model potential (OMP).
		Over the years, the standard form of the optical potential has evolved.
		This is		
		\[U_\textrm{opt}(r) = V_\textrm{coul}(r) + U_\textrm{vol}(r) + U_\textrm{surf}(r) + (\frac{\hbar}{m_\pi c\large})^2~U_\textrm{so}(r)~\textbf{l}\cdot\textbf{s}~~\]
		and each \(U(r)\) could be divided by real and imaginary part. </p>
		<p> If the appropriate optical potential parameters are known, you can enter those values directly in next [Potentials tab].
		Here several global OMPs are proposed for the reaction of interest.
		These global OMPs are originated from <A href=https://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/>RIPL-3</A> library.
		Alternatively the optical potential may be calculated using a folding model.</p>

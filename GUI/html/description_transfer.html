		<p> In a transfer reaction, a valence nucleon (or its cluster) is transferred from/to projectile to/from target.
		One could use optical model as a potential between core-valence in entrance and exit channel, and if needed, potential between core-core cluster.
		Also the bound states in projectile- and target-like cluster require bot only corresponding optical potentials but also their quantum numbers. </p>

		<p> From the inforamtion given at [Partition tab], the valence and core objects are deternmined.
		One have to specify the valence particle level of each bound state.
		For the convenience, available \(L\) and \(j\) will be suggested according to each system.
		Principal quantum number \(n\) should be required.
		Especially in case the valence is a single nucleon (proton or neutron), \(n\) is easily assumed in viwepoint of the shell model.
		The bindig energies (BE) are calculated automatically, but you can put the values directly if you want. 
		The spectroscopy amplitude (S.A.) is related to the probability of finding the valence particle  in a given state of core.

		One are required to select between the \(\textit{prior}\)- or \(\textit{post}\)-representation.
		The hamiltonain with prior form is
		\[ H_\textrm{prior} = T_\textbf{R} + U_i(R) + H_p(\textbf{r}) + \mathcal{V}_i(\textbf{R},\textbf{r}) \]
		where
		\[ \mathcal{V}_i(\textbf{R},\textbf{r}) = V_t(\textbf{r}^\prime) + U_{c^\prime c}(\textbf{R}_c) - U_i(R)~~. \]
		On the other hand, the hamiltonain with post form is
		\[ H_\textrm{post} = T_{\textbf{R}^\prime} + U_f(R^\prime) +H_t(\textbf{r}^\prime) + \mathcal{V}_f(\textbf{R}^\prime,\textbf{r}^\prime) \]
		where
		\[ \mathcal{V}_f(\textbf{R}^\prime,\textbf{r}^\prime) = V_p(\textbf{r}) + U_{c^\prime c}(\textbf{R}_c) - U_f(R^\prime)~~. \]
